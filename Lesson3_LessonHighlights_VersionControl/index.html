            <p class="lead">Version control is important because it keeps track of all the changes to a set of files over time in case you need to recall specific versions for later. A version control system is a very useful too because it allows you to compare changes over time or even change back your project to a previous form. It can be used as a recovery tool as well that if you mess up or somehow lose some files you can easily retrieve them. There are a few types of version control systems Local Version Control Systems, Centralized Version Control Systems, and Distributed Version Control Systems.

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that allows groups of people to work on code all at the same time and prevents them from getting in each others way. Git was created in 2005 and is relatively easy to use and maintains these goals that their creators sought after. They wanted Git to be fast, have a simple design, strong support for non linear development (thousands of parallel branches), it’s fully distributed, and lastly have the ability to handle larger projects. Git is completely opened sourced and extremely easy to use.

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git utilizes its’ own commands for example, git branch will make a new branch and call it “name”. Making new branches creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit. Another example is git push and that finds the commit you have made in the local branch and that the corresponding branch that the origin server does not have and sends them to the remote repository. Git checkout is a versatile command, but it’s main use is to switch between branches. Git merge will create a new commit with two parents and the resulting commit snapshot will have all of the work that has been completed in both branches.

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control System Advantages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many advantages of using a Version Control System. With a VC everyone on your team can work absolutely free on any file at anytime then the VCS allows you to merge all the changes into a common version. After changes are made in a VCS they only acknowledge that there is one project and then at anytime you need it you can have a snapshot of previous versions. Perhaps one of the most useful uses is that in a distributed VCS every member has a full version of the project and including the history so if your central server breaks down you can utilize your teammates local Git repository to recover all the lost work.

                <span class="text-muted">History of Git.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git started its development in April 2005 after the developers of Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper which was their source control management system that they had used. They wanted to create system that they could use like bit keeper but nothing free could meet their standards. Git is actually a random three letter combination that is pronounceable and not actually any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of the word “get” may or may not be relevant. It includes a very strong safeguard against corruption wether it’s accidental or malicious.
